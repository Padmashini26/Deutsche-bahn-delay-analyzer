# 🚇 Deutsche Bahn Delay Analyzer (Mock Data)

This project analyzes delay patterns in public transport (Deutsche Bahn) using a realistic mock dataset of 500+ entries.

## Files
- `train_delays.csv`: simulated dataset with station, train type, time, and delay
- `train_delay_analysis.ipynb`
  
## 📊 Visual Insights
- Average delay by station
- Delay trends across hours of the day
- Heatmap of delay patterns by weekday and time

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Upload the dataset into Google Colab or any interface of your choice
2. Copy-paste the code or run the file.
3. View and analyze the charts.

## Involves
- Data cleaning, time feature extraction
- Grouping and aggregating in pandas
- Visual storytelling with matplotlib & seaborn
